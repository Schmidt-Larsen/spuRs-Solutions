Solutions for exercises in Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R (spuRs) Second Edition

This repository is made to bring an solution manual for Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R (spuRs) avaliable for students who is using this book as part of there curriculium in a programming course.
This is also primarilly targetted to students at Aarhus Universitet BSS studying economics, who has been taken 3611: Programming in Quantitative Economics where this book has been curriculium up until spring 2023.

I'm doing this project also to help my own programming capabilities, currently having a programming course which builds heavy on the principles shown in this book.

If you have any inquries or suggesting, you're always welcome to contact me.
