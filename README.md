# spuRs-Solutions
Solutions for exercises in Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R (spuRs) Second Edition.

To my knowlegde only a couple of small solution manuals exist here on github. Solution for chapter 3-5 is heavily inspired (and many cases copied) from this solution attempts: https://github.com/rahulsoni9/Solutions-to-Exercises-in-Introduction-to-Scientific-Programming-and-Simulation-using-R

This repository is made to bring an solution manual for Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R (spuRs) avaliable for students who is using this book as part of there curriculium in a programming course.
This is also primarilly targetted to students at Aarhus Universitet BSS studying economics, who has been taken 3611: Programming in Quantitative Economics where this book has been curriculium up until spring 2023.

I'm doing this project also to help my own programming capabilities, currently having a programming course which builds heavy on the principles shown in this book.

If you have any inquries or suggesting, you're always welcome to contact me.
